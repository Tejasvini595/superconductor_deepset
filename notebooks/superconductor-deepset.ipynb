    "\n",
    "This notebook implements a DeepSet neural network for predicting superconductor critical temperature (Tc) based solely on chemical composition. The model:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Trains 50 independent models with different random seeds\n",
    "- Uses 22 elemental features from Mendeleev's periodic table + stoichiometry\n",
    "- Achieves **R² = 0.9170** and **RMSE = 9.95 K** on ensemble-averaged predictions\n",
    "- Provides SHAP-based interpretability analysis\n",

    "## Dataset Requirements\n",

    "**Place your dataset file in the `../data/` directory:**\n",
    "- Expected filename: `superconductors_kaggle_ready_v2.csv`\n",
    "- Columns: `element` (composition), `critical_temp_K` (target Tc)\n",
